# Tarneeb Game Project

This project is a digital recreation of **Tarneeb**, a traditional Lebanese card game. It started as a school project but quickly grew into something I wanted to develop further, blending cultural heritage with programming. This project aims to modernize and preserve a piece of Lebanese culture in the digital world.

## Game Overview
**Tarneeb** is a trick-taking card game, typically played with four players. The objective is to win as many tricks as possible by playing the highest card of the lead suit or the trump suit (Tarneeb). The rules are simple yet strategic, making it a timeless favorite across generations.

## Features
- Implementation of core game mechanics, including:
  - Dealing cards
  - Setting the Tarneeb (trump) suit
  - Playing tricks
  - Scoring system
- Single-player mode against AI (if applicable)
- User-friendly and intuitive interface
- Modern adaptation while staying true to traditional rules

## Rules (Brief)
1. Each player is dealt 13 cards.
2. One suit is randomly chosen as the **Tarneeb** (trump) suit.
3. Players take turns playing cards; the highest card of the lead suit or Tarneeb wins the trick.
4. The game consists of 13 rounds, and the player with the most tricks wins.

## Why This Project?
I wanted to represent a piece of my Lebanese heritage in my programming work. By creating this project, I aimed to combine my love for coding with my appreciation for traditional games, ensuring they remain accessible to future generations.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
